# Sportive Diary

The system walks each athlete through a series of drills and exercises designed to enhance their technical ability and in turn improve their performance on the field. Each athlete is provided with a customized developmental program that is geared towards their unique needs. One of the many unique features of the system is its built-in motivational reward system that entices each player to continue practicing and striving towards the next reward level.
